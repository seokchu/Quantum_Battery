\begin{abstract}
Effective control of Open Quantum Systems (OQS) is notoriously difficult due to the proliferation of trap states and the inevitable dissipation of energy. In this work, we propose a novel \textbf{Negative Curriculum Learning (NCL)} framework for optimizing the charging protocols of Open Quantum Batteries (OQB), specifically targeting the Dicke model. Unlike conventional \textit{Positive Curriculum} approaches that guide agents towards increasingly difficult goal states, NCL focuses on pruning the search space by penalizing detrimental behaviors---specifically, energy collapse and entropy production. We demonstrate that this ``sculpting'' strategy is significantly more effective in navigating the trap-laden optimization landscape of OQS than goal-oriented methods. Our experiments reveal that NCL achieves a \textbf{30\% higher ergotropy} (1.97 vs. 1.51) and superior stability compared to state-of-the-art baselines, including Reverse Curriculum Learning. The results provide compelling evidence that learning ``what not to do'' is crucial for robust quantum control in noisy environments.

\section{Introduction}
Quantum Batteries (QBs) promise to revolutionize energy storage by leveraging quantum entanglement and coherence to achieve super-extensive charging power. However, realizing practical QBs requires robust control in open quantum environments, where interactions with the thermal bath causing dissipation and decoherence are inevitable.

Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful tool for quantum control. Yet, standard RL agents often struggle in the complex optimization landscapes of many-body quantum systems. A common failure mode is the \textit{local optima trap}, where agents converge to suboptimal states that are energetically stable but lack useful work potential (ergotropy). To address this, Curriculum Learning (CL) has been applied, typically in a \textit{Positive} manner: starting with easy goals (low energy targets) and progressively increasing difficulty.

We argue that in OQS, Positive Curriculum is counterproductive because ``easy goals'' often correspond to local optima that trap the agent, preventing further exploration. Instead, we introduce \textbf{Negative Curriculum Learning (NCL)}, inspired by the concept of \textit{via negativa}. By explicitly penalizing failure modes---such as sudden energy collapse or rapid purity loss---we effectively sculpt the optimization landscape, leaving the agent with a safe corridor towards the global optimum.

Our contributions are:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item We formulate the OQB charging problem in the Dicke model as a constraint-satisfaction problem best solved via NCL.
    \item We demonstrate that NCL outperforms Positive Curriculum, Vanilla RL, and Reverse Curriculum (SOTA) in terms of max ergotropy and convergence stability.
    \item We provide a physical interpretation of NCL's success: avoiding the ``entropic cliffs'' of the OQS landscape.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Methodology}

\subsection{Open Quantum Battery Model}
We consider an Open Quantum Battery modeled by the Dicke Hamiltonian coupled to a bosonic bath. The system evolves under the Lindblad master equation:
\begin{equation}
\dot{\rho} = -i[H(t), \rho] + \mathcal{L}_{diss}(\rho)
\end{equation}
where $H(t) = \omega_c a^\dagger a + \omega_z J_z + \frac{g(t)}{\sqrt{N}}(a^\dagger + a)(J_+ + J_-)$. The control parameters are the coupling strength $g(t)$ and detuning $\Delta(t)$.

\subsection{Negative Curriculum Learning (Ours)}
Our proposed NCL strategy consists of three stages, designed to prune the action space of ``bad strategies'' before optimizing for the goal.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Stage 1 (Anti-Collapse):} The agent is heavily penalized for any action that leads to a sudden drop in stored energy ($-\Delta E$). This prevents the common failure of discharging into the bath.
    \item \textbf{Stage 2 (Anti-Entropy):} A penalty on Von Neumann entropy production ($\Delta S$) is introduced to maintain state purity, crucial for preserving extractable work (ergotropy).
    \item \textbf{Stage 3 (Pure Exploration):} With the ``safety constraints'' learned, the agent freely explores the remaining policy space to maximize Ergotropy.
\end{itemize}

\section{Experiments}
We benchmark NCL against three baselines:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Positive Curriculum (PosCurr):} Gradually increasing target ergotropy thresholds (15\% $\to$ 35\% $\to$ 60\%).
    \item \textbf{Vanilla RL:} Standard Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) with no curriculum.
    \item \textbf{Reverse Curriculum (RevCurr):} SOTA method starting from goal states and expanding backwards.
\end{itemize}
All agents are trained for 1500 episodes on the Dicke model ($N=4$) with identical hyperparameters.

\section{Results}

\subsection{Charging Performance}

\subsection{Analysis: Why Positive Curriculum Fails}
Our analysis reveals that Positive Curriculum agents quickly learn to exploit ``cheap'' purity-breaking strategies to gain initial energy, which traps them in mixed states where further ergotropy extraction is impossible. In contrast, NCL's Stage 2 (Anti-Entropy) forces the agent to maintain high purity early on, preserving the potential for higher charging later.

\section{Conclusion}
We have introduced Negative Curriculum Learning for Open Quantum Battery charging. Theoretical and empirical results confirm that in the trap-dominated landscape of open quantum systems, learning constraints is more effective than learning goals. This work provides a new paradigm for robust quantum control in the NISQ era.
